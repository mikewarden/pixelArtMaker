# pixelArtMaker
A simple pixel-based painting app based on the final project of the Grow with Google Udacity Challenge Scholarship.

I followed the basic guidelines for this project, as well as implementing a double-click erase feature and scaling down the pixel-size to allow for more detail.
Any suggestions are welcome, thanks.
